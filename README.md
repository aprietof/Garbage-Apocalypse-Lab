# Garbage Apocalypse Lab

Someone mixed up the trash labels for the recycling cans, and now nobody knows where to put their trash. We've been asked to come in and fix the labels so that it's easy to know where to throw our recycling.

Let's use our new JQuery skills to select and modify the HTML elements inside **`index.html`** until our page looks like this:

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab, and then cd into it.

In the folder, you should find **`index.html`**.

* Add the JQuery library to the `index.html` file.

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

* Create a new javascript file and include it inside `index.html` (name it whatever your want). Remember to link to it using a `<script>` tag.
* Remember to write your javascript code after the HTML document is ready. (Use `$(document).ready()`)
* Select and modify elements using JQuery.
* Only write code inside your javascript file (no other file should be modified)

## The Mission

Ready for the challenge???

Your mission is to select elements using JQuery selectors ***(elements, ids or classes)*** and complete the following tasks:

1. Center the ***"Let's Save The World"*** heading.
2. Add the right text to each **paragraph** inside the boxes as follows:

```
Red => Plastic
Blue => Paper
Green => Glass
Brown => Organic
Yellow => Metal 
```

3. Add the right background color to the labels 
4. Make every label into a perfect circle ***(You might want to use the border radius css propierty)***
5. Make All labels text white
6. Make the metal label text black

Time to save the world and prevent garbage apocalypse.
