Let's use our new JQuery skills to select and modify the HTML elements inside **`index.html`** until our page looks like this:

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab, and then cd into it.

In the folder, you should find **`index.html`**.

* Add the JQuery library to the `index.html` file.

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

* Create a new javascript file and include it inside `index.html` (name it whatever your want).
* Remember to write your javascript code after the HTML document is ready.
* Select and modify elements using JQuery.
* Only write code inside your javascript file (no other file should be modified)

## The Mission

Ready for a challenge???

Your mission is to select every needed element using JQuery selectors ***(elements, ids or classes)*** and complete the following tasks:

- Center the ***"Let's Save The World"*** heading.
- Add the right text to each **paragraph** inside the boxes as follows:

```
Red => Plastic
Blue => Paper
Green => Glass
Brown => Organic
Yellow => Metal 
```

- Add the right background color to the labels 
- Make every label into a perfect circle ***(You might want to use the border radius css propierty)***
- Make All labels text white
- Make the metal label text black

Time to save the world and prevent garbage apocalypse.
